# Integrative Network-Analysis for early-stage Alzheimer's disease

This repository contains the scripts and data used in the study titled "Integrative Network Analysis Reveals Novel Moderators of Aβ-Tau Interaction in Alzheimer's Disease", which investigates the mechanisms of interaction between amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins. The study applies deep learning-based network integration methods to uncover factors that moderate Aβ-tau interactions, providing insights into early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.

## Overview
This repository includes scripts for integrative network analysis that uncovers moderators of Aβ-tau interactions in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to network integration and analysis, this repository also includes the scripts for constructing AlzPPMap, a visualization tool developed for network analysis. AlzPPMap enables users to explore and visualize integrated networks derived from proteomics and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, allowing for a detailed examination of molecular relationships in Alzheimer's disease.

## Main Data
- Proteomics Data: Obtained from the [Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)](https://doi.org/10.7303/syn2580853).
- PPI Data: Retrieved from the [STRING Database](https://string-db.org/).
- Histopathological Data: Accessed from the [ACT Study](https://actagingresearch.org/).
- Microglia snRNA-seq Data: Available from the [Link](https://braincelldata.org/resource) and [Link](https://doi.org/10.7303/syn2580853).

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results of this study, it is important to first obtain the necessary datasets. The study uses both publicly available and controlled access data:

- Public Data: Download publicly available data, such as the PPI data from the STRING database.
